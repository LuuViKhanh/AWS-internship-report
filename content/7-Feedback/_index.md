>Here you can freely share your personal opinions about your experiences participating in the First Cloud Journey program, helping the FCJ team improve areas that need enhancement based on the following categories:

### General Assessment

**1. Work Environment**  
The work environment at FCJ feels professional yet very approachable. The atmosphere is comfortable and friendly, with everyone ready to support each other, even outside working hours. The workspace is well-organized and modern, helping me stay focused and work more effectively each day.

**2. Support from Mentors / Admin Team**  
Mentors always explain every issue thoroughly, patiently guide through implementation steps, and provide suggestions that help me find solutions independently. The admin team provides very quick support, especially with documentation, processes, and necessary information, ensuring my learning process remains uninterrupted.

**3. Alignment Between Work and Academic Major**  
The assigned tasks align well with the foundational knowledge I learned but are still challenging enough to expand my skills. Many new technologies and processes not covered at school have helped me supplement practical knowledge, bridging the gap between theory and real-world business applications.

**4. Event Organization**  
FCJ regularly organizes events, workshops, and internal sharing sessions that enhance knowledge and strengthen connections among members. These events are well-prepared with valuable content, creating spaces for everyone to network, learn, and relax after work. This is a major plus as it helps interns integrate faster and feel like part of the community.

**5. Culture & Team Spirit**  
The culture at FCJ is very positive: respect – support – grow together. Everyone is always willing to share knowledge, provide sincere feedback, and help each other when projects get intense. The teamwork spirit is very strong, making me feel included even as just an intern.
