# Event Report: "AWS Cloud Mastery Series #1 - AI/ML/GenAI on AWS – Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock"

### Event Purpose

- Introduce an overview of AWS's AI/ML/GenAI ecosystem.
- Provide an overview of Managed AI Services on AWS, their uses, and pricing models.
- Master Prompt Engineering techniques applied to real-world use cases.
- Explore Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture.
- Introduce Foundation Models and popular types of Foundation Models (FMs).

### Speaker List

- **Lam Tuan Kiet** – Sr DevOps Engineer, FPT Software
- **Danh Hoang Hieu Nghi** – AI Engineer, Renova Cloud
- **Dinh Le Hoang Anh** – Cloud Engineer Trainee, First Cloud AI Journey

### Highlighted Content

#### Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock

- Introduction to popular Foundation Models (Claude, Llama, Titan) and selection criteria based on use cases: text analysis, chatbots, reasoning, content creation, and embedding.
- Practice with **Prompting Techniques**:
  - **Zero-shot:** model responds directly without examples → suitable for simple questions.
  - **Few-shot:** provide sample examples for the model to learn patterns → increases accuracy in specialized tasks.
  - **Chain-of-Thought (CoT):** requires the model to reason step-by-step → improves logic problems, data analysis, and reasoning.
- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation):** combines LLM with enterprise data (S3, DynamoDB, Aurora, etc.) to reduce hallucination and create accurate context-based answers.
- **Bedrock Agents:** build multi-step workflows, call APIs, access data, and automate processes without writing complex backend code.
- **Guardrails:** establish content safety policies (filter toxic content, restrict topics, regex filtering, mandatory schemas) to ensure AI complies with enterprise standards.

#### Managed AI Services on AWS
- **Rekognition**: analyzes images/videos (detect objects, faces, text, moderation).
- **Transcribe:** converts speech to text, suitable for call centers and captions.
- **Polly:** generates natural speech from text.
- **Comprehend**: natural language analysis (sentiment, key phrases, PII detection).
- **Translate:** real-time or batch machine translation.
- **Textract:** extracts data from scanned documents/PDFs.
- **Personalize**: builds recommendation systems like Netflix/Amazon.

#### Mini Kahoot Review
- Mini quiz helps reinforce knowledge about **prompting techniques** (zero-shot, few-shot, CoT, structured output) through scenario-based questions.
- Increases interaction and creates a lively atmosphere, helping learners grasp content more easily than pure theory.

### Personal Experience and Lessons Learned

- **Prompting Techniques:** Most impressed with **zero-shot, few-shot, and CoT** techniques, helping me clearly understand how to deploy GenAI in real projects.
- **Hands-on Demo with Bedrock:** Helped visualize the end-to-end process of building and deploying AI.
- **Mini Kahoot:** Reinforced knowledge on the spot, helping remember important steps and prompt techniques longer.
- **Networking:** Connected with the AWS community and learned from local experts, expanding collaboration opportunities.

### Event Experience

Attending the workshop **"AI/ML/GenAI on AWS – Generative AI with Amazon Bedrock"** was an extremely valuable experience, giving me a systematic view of how to build and deploy GenAI solutions on AWS. Some highlights I gained:

#### Learning from AWS Experts
- AWS speakers shared many practical perspectives on selecting Foundation Models, designing RAG architecture, and operating GenAI in enterprises.
- Clear illustrative examples helped me better understand how to apply GenAI to real-world problems like document analysis, chatbot creation, or business process automation.

#### Discovering AWS Tools & Services
- Direct experience with Amazon Bedrock and Guardrails helped me clearly understand how AWS supports safe and efficient GenAI deployment.
- I also learned how to leverage available AI services like Rekognition, Comprehend, Transcribe, or Textract to quickly solve computer vision and NLP needs.

#### Connecting and Exchanging
- The workshop was a great opportunity to exchange with the AWS user community and listen to practical experiences from teams that have deployed GenAI.

#### Lessons Learned
- Using RAG, Bedrock Agents, and Prompting Techniques helps reduce dependency, increase scalability, and improve resilience for GenAI solutions.
- Managed AI Services and tools like Amazon Bedrock can significantly boost development productivity.
