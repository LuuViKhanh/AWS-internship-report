# Event Report: "[AWS GenAI Builder Club] AI-Driven Development Life Cycle – Reimagining Software Engineering"

### Event Purpose

The [AWS GenAI Builder Club] AI-Driven Development Life Cycle event was organized to help participants better understand how artificial intelligence (AI) is transforming the entire modern software development process.

Specifically, the program aimed to:

- Introduce the AI-DLC (AI-Driven Life Cycle) methodology – a new model that integrates AI into every phase of the software development lifecycle.

- Clarify the role and benefits of AI in shortening time, optimizing processes, and improving software product quality.

- Introduce the Kiro.dev platform – an AI IDE (Integrated Development Environment) supported by AWS, helping development teams transform from ideas to finished products more quickly.

### Speaker List

- **Toan Huynh** - Specialist SA
- **My Nguyen** - Sr. Prototyping Architect, Amazon Web Services - ASEAN

### Highlighted Content

#### AI-DLC Methodology – AI-Driven Software Development Approach

The **AI-DLC** methodology is considered a breakthrough in software engineering, where AI not only supports programming but is integrated throughout the entire development lifecycle:

- From the ideation phase, AI helps suggest requirements and define project scope.

- During design and programming, AI assists in writing code, creating design documentation, and detecting errors early.

- During testing and deployment, AI can automate processes, predict risks, and propose improvements.

#### Kiro.dev – The AI IDE

Kiro.dev was introduced as an AI-powered IDE (Integrated Development Environment with AI) that helps users create applications from design to working implementation using just prompts.

Notable features include:

- **Automatic project structure generation** including files like plan.md, /inception/ directory, and descriptive documents.

- **Task management (AI tasks)** according to plan, where each part can be assigned to AI for execution while humans supervise.

- **Flexible interaction:** if the prompt isn't accurate, users can edit, regenerate, or switch to different AI models to achieve desired results.

#### Amazon Q Developer

Amazon Q Developer operates as an AI assistant integrated into AWS Console and VS Code with outstanding capabilities:

- **Natural code generation and understanding**: you can ask in natural language and Q Developer will generate complete code.

- **Project context integration**: Q Developer understands the entire codebase in the workspace, providing accurate context-specific answers.

### What Was Learned

#### Understanding AI-DLC, Kiro.dev, and Amazon Q Developer

- **AI-DLC is a methodology**: a holistic approach to software development with AI at every stage.
- **Kiro.dev is the AI-DLC execution platform**: a tool supporting rapid application development based on ideas.
- **Amazon Q Developer**: is an AI assistant specifically for developers, helping accelerate development and deployment directly on AWS environments.

#### Using Prompt Templates and Managing AI Output

Learning to design effective prompts is a key skill:

- Clearly define the role that AI will assume.

- Write clear plans and AI tasks.

- Manage AI results through the /inception/ directory for easy refinement.

- Always review output because AI can generate incorrect or inappropriate content.

#### Human-AI Collaboration Mindset

Speakers emphasized that AI is a collaborator, not a replacement.

AI can generate ideas, write code, and test, but humans are responsible for verification, evaluation, and direction.

This opens up a new mindset in software development – where AI and humans co-create together.

### Event Experience

#### Learning from Highly Skilled Speakers

- Speakers from AWS and major technology organizations shared **best practices** in modern application design.
- Through real case studies, I better understood how to apply **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)** and **Event-Driven Architecture** to large projects.

#### Applying Modern Tools

- Directly explored **Amazon Q Developer**, an AI tool supporting SDLC from planning to maintenance.
- Learned how to **automate code transformation** and pilot serverless with **AWS Lambda**, thereby improving development productivity.

#### Lessons Learned

- AI-DLC and tools like Kiro.dev or Amazon Q Developer are changing how we program.

- Thanks to AI, the process from idea → design → deployment can be significantly shortened.

- Learning to communicate with and control AI will become a core skill for modern developers.

- The future of software is not "AI replacing humans," but "humans + AI = double productivity."
