Throughout my internship at **AWS Vietnam** from **September 8th** to **November 28**, I had the opportunity to learn, practice, and apply the knowledge I acquired at university to a real working environment.

I participated in **a project building an e-commerce website specializing in selling products for pet birds**, through which I improved my skills in **programming, analysis, report writing, workplace communication, and self-learning**.

Regarding work attitude, I always strived to complete tasks well, comply with regulations, and actively communicate with colleagues to improve work efficiency.

To objectively reflect on the internship process, I would like to self-evaluate based on the following criteria:

### Areas for Improvement

* I need to learn how to analyze problems from multiple perspectives, understand the root causes deeply to provide optimal and quick solutions.
* I need to improve my ability to present ideas and respond in meetings and workplace communication to ensure exchanges are always clear and effective.
* Although I have been proactive in learning, I need to further enhance my ability to find resources, approach new technologies, and apply them to work.
